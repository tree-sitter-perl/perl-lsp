# perl-lsp

A Perl LSP server built on ts-parser-perl (crates.io) and tower-lsp.

## Build & test

```
cargo build --release
cargo test                              # unit tests
./run_e2e.sh                            # e2e tests (needs nvim + release build)
perl-lsp --dump-package <root> <pkg>    # debug type inference for a package
```

## Architecture

Four layers, data flows down only:

```
LSP adapter      symbols.rs, backend.rs       → LSP protocol types
Cross-file       module_index/_resolver/_cache → CachedModule (Arc<FileAnalysis>)
Builder          builder.rs                   → produces FileAnalysis
Data model       file_analysis.rs             → FileAnalysis (serde, bincode-cacheable)
```

See `docs/ROADMAP.md` for the forward design corpus entry point. `docs/adr/file-store-and-resolve.md` covers the landed cross-file unification (single role-tagged FileStore + RoleMask + resolve_symbol). Residual forward work in `docs/prompt-unification-residual.md`; the next architectural pillar (graph walking) in `docs/prompt-graph-walking.md`.

### Rules (read before writing code)

1. **All tree-sitter CST traversal happens inside `build()`.** No other file walks tree-sitter nodes, calls `child_by_field_name`, or uses `TreeCursor`. To add CST-derived data: extend `visit_*` in `builder.rs`. Builder plugins (separate modules taking `&mut FileAnalysis` + `&Tree` + `&[u8]`) are fine — they preserve the single entry point. Multiple post-walk passes inside `build()` are allowed and named (see "Build pipeline phases") for cases needing resolved state.

2. **`file_analysis.rs` is the single source of truth.** All analysis results live in `FileAnalysis`. Query methods belong here. No `tree_sitter` imports.

3. **`symbols.rs` is a thin adapter** — `FileAnalysis` types → LSP types. No analysis, no tree walks, no Perl semantics decisions.

4. **`module_resolver.rs` calls the builder, then queries `FileAnalysis`** — never walks the tree directly.

5. **DRY: shared extraction logic goes on `FileAnalysis`.** Two callers needing the same data → one method, both call it.

6. **`cursor_context.rs` is the position-dependent exception** — gets a tree + source for completion/sig-help context. Does NOT modify `FileAnalysis`.

7. **Every meaningful token gets a ref.** If `ref_at(pos)` returns nothing or returns too-broad, the builder is missing emission. Overlapping refs → `ref_at` returns the **narrowest span**. Common gaps: fat-comma keys in calls (`connect(timeout => 30)` needs its own `HashKeyAccess`), hash literal keys, framework-synthesized entities (Moo `has name` → `HashKeyDef` for constructor, not just accessor).

8. **Plugin-synthesized content is owned by `PluginNamespace`, not Perl classes.** See `docs/adr/plugin-system.md`. Cross-file lookup goes through `ModuleIndex::for_each_entity_bridged_to(class, ...)` — do NOT add parallel reverse indexes (retired: `class_content_index`, `modules_with_class_content`). Plugins have **emit hooks** (`on_use`, `on_function_call`, `on_method_call`) — parse-time, declarative, return `Vec<EmitAction>` — and **query hooks** (`on_signature_help`, `on_completion`) — cursor-time, imperative, for shape-dependent behavior. `Silent` / `exclusive` answers suppress native paths when plugin knows native will mishandle the slot.

9. **Provenance: derived refs trace to source** for rename/cross-ref. Constant folding (`my $m = 'process'; $self->$m()`), `has` declarations (accessor + constructor key + internal hash key), import lists, return hash keys → caller derefs (`HashKeyOwner::Sub`), package→file path, inherited overrides.

10. **Never special-case for a particular shape — you are always wrong.** Any code that branches on "is this method named `search`", "does this base equal `DBIx::Class::ResultSet`", "did this come from a plugin vs the real walker", or "is this return-type a String" is encoding a partial enumeration of shapes that match a behavior. The list is always incomplete — tomorrow's case that should match silently doesn't; tomorrow's case that shouldn't match silently does. **Fix:** encode the "wants behavior X" property on the *type / value / witness* itself, so consumers ask the value the question and the value answers. The consumer never sees the shape.

   Recurring forms of this antipattern:
   - **Method-name allowlists** in consumers (`if target_name in {search, find}`). Push the rule onto the *type*: `InferredType::hash_key_class()` for the parametric-arg case. See `docs/adr/parametric-types.md`.
   - **Lossy-string returns** (`Option<String>` for a class name when the source had `Option<InferredType>`). The string is a consumer-side projection, not a return-type contract. Helpers that resolve "what type does this expression produce" return `Option<InferredType>`. Class-name accessors (`class_name()`, `dispatch_class()`, etc.) are caller-side methods on the rich type. Cleanup pass landed; back-compat thin wrappers remain (`method_call_invocant_class`, `resolve_invocant_class_tree`, `invocant_text_to_class`) — they each call the typed sibling and project at the consumer.
   - **Real vs synthetic branches** in worker code (`if synthetic { skip step }`). Synthetic paths run the same body, factored to a function. Termination concerns go on the dispatcher (seen-sets, depth caps) — not on the worker.
   - **Per-base / per-name lookup tables in core** for behavior plugins should own. The plugin trait carries the rule; core dispatches generically.

   The discipline is hard because the special case is always the smallest diff right now. Reaching up to the general path is the larger commit. Do the larger commit anyway — the special case never stays cheap, and provenance / observability / future flavors of the same rule all rot when they're not paying it forward.

### File map

- `main.rs` — entry, CLI modes (`--rename`, `--workspace-symbol`, `--dump-package`, `--version`). `cli_full_startup(root)` = "act like LSP just started".
- `backend.rs` — `LanguageServer` impl, request routing.
- `document.rs` — open-file `Document` (tree + text + analysis + stable_outline).
- `file_store.rs` — unified store for open + workspace FileAnalyses, role-tagged, dedup'd by path.
- `file_analysis.rs` — data model; serde-derived.
- `builder.rs` — CST→FileAnalysis. ONLY tree-sitter consumer.
- `pod.rs` — POD→markdown via tree-sitter-pod.
- `cursor_context.rs` — position-dependent context.
- `symbols.rs` — LSP adapter.
- `resolve.rs` — cross-file `refs_to` + `RoleMask` (OPEN/WORKSPACE/DEPENDENCY/BUILTIN). All cross-file queries route here.
- `module_index.rs` — cross-file dep API, `CachedModule`, `SubInfo`, reverse index (`func → modules`).
- `module_resolver.rs` — background `std::thread`, in-process parsing, workspace indexing (Rayon).
- `module_cache.rs` — SQLite (schema v9, bincode+zstd FileAnalysis blob).
- `cpanfile.rs` — cpanfile via tree-sitter queries.
- `witnesses.rs` — witness bag + reducer registry for type inference.

## Cross-file resolution

- `ModuleIndex` runs a dedicated `std::thread` for FS I/O (never blocks tokio). `Arc<DashMap>` shared with async handlers.
- `CachedModule { path, analysis: Arc<FileAnalysis> }` — full FileAnalysis survives module boundary (refs, type_constraints, call_bindings, framework_imports, package_parents). `SubInfo<'_>` view gives ExportedSub-style accessors.
- Reverse index: `DashMap<func_name, Vec<module_name>>` for O(1) exporter lookup.
- SQLite cache per project at `~/.cache/perl-lsp/<hash>/modules.db`. `EXTRACT_VERSION` bump triggers priority re-resolution without dropping the table.
- **Plugin fingerprint** — bundled plugin sources + every `.rhai` in `$PERL_LSP_PLUGIN_DIR` are hashed. Mismatch on startup hard-clears modules table (same machinery as `validate_inc_paths`). Editing a plugin invalidates cache so QA isn't served stale blobs.
- Async handlers only call `_cached` methods (zero I/O).
- After resolution, diagnostics refresh for all open files (clears stale false positives).

### Cross-file enrichment

`enrich_imported_types_with_keys()` on `FileAnalysis` propagates imported return types and hash keys: pushes `TypeConstraint`s for call bindings to imported funcs, injects synthetic `HashKeyDef` symbols for cross-file hash-key completion. Idempotent: `base_type_constraint_count` / `base_symbol_count` / `base_witness_count` set after initial build; enrichment truncates back to baseline before appending. `rebuild_enrichment_indices()` rebuilds index maps after. Called from `publish_diagnostics()` and the resolver refresh callback.

## Type inference (witness bag)

**The bag is the only source of types.** Type production is `bag.push(...)`; type consumption is `bag_query_attachment(att)` through `ReducerRegistry::query`. There is no second source. `Builder::infer_expression_type` is gone; closed-syntax cases live in `expr_payload`'s match called by `emit_expr_witness`. `Builder.resolved_returns` is gone; walk-time synthesis pushes `Symbol(sid)` witnesses directly. See `docs/adr/bag-canonical.md` for the load-bearing decisions.

**Edges, not values.** If a registry query on attachment `A` already resolves through an edge chase, do NOT re-push the materialized `InferredType(t)` onto `A` as a "cache." The registry's chase IS the canonical flow; the materialization is a parallel store that drifts. Every published witness is either (a) a source value the walker uniquely knows (a literal's type, a plugin's declaration, a framework's `ReturnExpr`) or (b) an `Edge` to another attachment.

**Two strict phases:**

1. **Collect** in `Builder::populate_witness_bag()`: mirror every `TypeConstraint` as Variable witness; push `HashRefAccess` from `$v->{k}` refs; push `mutation` Facts on hash-key writes; push `Symbol(sid) → Edge(Expr(last_expr_span))` for each Sub/Method scope without explicit returns (the implicit-return chain).

2. **Reduce** via `ReducerRegistry` in `src/witnesses.rs`. Reducers in registration order — earlier entries claim first:
   - `PluginOverrideReducer` — Plugin-priority `Symbol(_) + InferredType` short-circuit. `WitnessSource::priority()` returns 100 for `Plugin(_)`; 10 for everything else.
   - `ReturnExprReducer` — `WitnessPayload::ReturnExpr(_)` shapes: `Concrete` / `Receiver` (substitutes `q.receiver`) / `Operator(RowOf(_))` / `UnionOnArgs` (dispatches `q.arity_hint`). See `docs/adr/return-expr.md`.
   - `SymbolReturnArmFold` — `SymbolReturnArm(sid)` attachment; folds per-arm `Edge(Expr(body_span))` witnesses via `resolve_return_type` (1+ arms agree → `Some(t)`, disagree → `None`). `Symbol(sid)` carries one `Edge(SymbolReturnArm(sid))` chain witness per arm so consumers querying the symbol's return materialize through.
   - `BranchArmFold` — agreement across ≥2 `branch_arm`-source `Edge` witnesses on `Variable` / `Expr` for ternary RHS.
   - `FrameworkAwareTypeFold` — folds `TypeObservation` (rep / class / bless / numeric / regex / string) using package's `FrameworkFact`. Class-identity dominates rep when frameworks agree (Mojo `$self->{x} = ...; return $self` keeps `ClassName`). Temporal: skips witnesses past the query point.
   - `MethodOnClassReducer` — `MethodOnClass{class, name}` primary fallback. Inheritance + cross-file bridges resolve via `query_rec`'s structural recursion on the same attachment shape, with inheritance edges (`MethodOnClass{child, m} → Edge(MethodOnClass{parent, m})`) pushed by the writeback so the registry walks them like any other edge.
   - `SubReturnReducer` — `Symbol(_) + InferredType` latest-wins, runs last; backstop when no higher-priority reducer answered.
   - `ExprReturn` — `Expr(_) + InferredType` latest-wins.

**Single shared query path.** `query_variable_type(bag, scopes, framework, var, scope, point)` and `query_sub_return_type(bag, symbols, name, arity_hint, ...)` in `witnesses.rs` are the only scope-walk + framework + reducer dispatch sites. `FileAnalysis::inferred_type_via_bag` / `sub_return_type_at_arity` (query-time) and `Builder::bag_query_attachment` / `bag_query_expr_span` (build-time) are thin wrappers over the registry. Identical rules in both by construction.

**`TypeConstraint` is an input-parameter shape.** The struct exists so callers can package `(variable, scope, span, inferred_type)` for `push_type_constraint(tc)`, which translates it into Variable witnesses on the bag. There is no `Vec<TypeConstraint>` field — the bag is the only storage. Enrichment truncates the bag back to `base_witness_count` before re-deriving.

**Query entry points** (call these, not internal helpers):

- `inferred_type_via_bag(var, point)` — variable type at a point.
- `sub_return_type_at_arity(name, arity)` — sub return type (locals + imports).
- `method_call_return_type_via_bag(ref_idx)` — Expression-attached return type (lets `$r->get('/x')->to('Y#z')` resolve `->to`'s receiver without an intermediate variable).
- `find_method_return_type(class, method, module_index, arity)` — class-keyed method return type. Thin wrapper that builds a `MethodOnClass{class, name}` `ReducerQuery`; the registry handles inheritance walks and cross-file bridges.
- `mutated_keys_on_class(class)` — dynamic-key completion on `$self->{`.

**Legacy:** `FileAnalysis::inferred_type(var, point)` is raw-state introspection only (no framework/branch/arity rules). Doc-flagged "not a type query." Two narrow uses: `resolve_method_call_types` early-out, and tests asserting on raw builder state. Use `inferred_type_via_bag` everywhere else.

**Adding type behavior = adding a reducer.** Never bypass the bag with direct `InferredType` writes or parallel query helpers. New fact → push a witness (`Edge` if it routes to an existing source); new fold → write a reducer.

**Cache durability:** `WitnessBag` and `package_framework` are `#[serde(default)]`, ride bincode+zstd cache blob. Bump `EXTRACT_VERSION` on shape/rule changes.

### Build pipeline phases

`build_with_plugins()` in `builder.rs` runs in fixed order. Each pass consumes state the previous produced.

1. **live walk** (`visit_*`) — emits Symbols/Refs/Scopes/TypeConstraints, queues plugin emissions, records `ReturnInfo`s (scope + arity branch + body span — no walk-time types). Walks emit `Expr(span)` witnesses via `emit_expr_witness` at every meaningful expression node (literal types directly, name-dependent shapes as `Edge` payloads pointing at `Variable` / `Symbol` / `Expression`).
2. `resolve_variable_refs()` — scalar refs → `resolves_to`.
3. `resolve_hash_key_owners()` — HashKeyAccess → HashKeyOwner via TC types.
4. `apply_type_overrides()` — plugin manifests push **Plugin-priority** witnesses on `Symbol(sub_id)`. The `PluginOverrideReducer`'s priority short-circuit (Plugin > Builder) makes them dominate every other reducer. Provenance is recorded as `TypeProvenance::PluginOverride` so `--dump-package` can answer "why does this return X?". Runs BEFORE the worklist fold so dependent inference sees overrides via the bag.
5. `populate_witness_bag()` — one-shot bag seed. Mirrors walk-time `TypeConstraint`s as Variable witnesses; pushes `HashRefAccess` Observations from `$v->{k}` refs; pushes `mutation` Facts on hash-key writes; pushes `Symbol(sid) → Edge(Expr(last_expr_span))` for each user-defined Sub/Method scope without explicit returns (the implicit-return chain). Bag is canonical after this.
6. `fold_to_fixed_point(chain_idx)` — **the worklist fold**. Each iteration runs `ChainTypingReducer::PreFold` (assignment + return-arm refresh) followed by `resolve_return_types`: `emit_arity_return_witnesses` (re-emittable per-Symbol UnionOnArgs publication for arity-discriminated subs) → `emit_method_call_return_edges` (re-emittable `Expression(refidx) → Edge(MethodOnClass{...})` for known invocants) → `seed_return_types_from_bag` (pure read; queries `Symbol(sid)` per Sub/Method scope, builds the name-keyed `return_types` map for downstream consumers, preserves `PluginOverride` / `Delegation` provenance) → `write_back_sub_return_types` (pushes `MethodOnClass{class, name} → Edge(Symbol(sid))` for primaries; plugin-namespace bridges; inheritance edges) → `propagate_call_bindings_to_constraints` → `fixup_call_bound_hash_key_owners`. The loop exits when the snapshot — per-Sub registry answer + bag len + invocant cache size — stops moving; `MAX_FOLD_ITERATIONS = 64` is the debug-only safety net. After the lattice settles, `ChainTypingReducer::PostFold` runs once to fill `invocant_class` on `MethodCall` refs.
7. `resolve_tail_pod_docs()` — POD docs for subs lacking preceding doc.
8. `FileAnalysis::new(...)` — construct FA, build indices, `resolve_method_call_types(None)` as text-based MCB fallback.
9. `fa.finalize_post_walk()` — seal `base_*_count` for idempotent re-enrichment.

`Builder::resolve_invocant_class_tree` is the **single** symbolic-execution function (chain typing, return-arm refresh, invocant filling). Adding a second is wrong; add cases. `FileAnalysis::resolve_expression_type` is the FA-side mirror at query time (cursor context, hover, completion) — keep them in sync.

### Worklist invariants

The fold driver in step 6 is the only place type inference iterates. Adding a new fact-fold means **adding a reducer**, not changing the driver:

- **Reducers are stateless.** A `WitnessReducer` claims a `WitnessAttachment` shape (`Symbol(_)` / `Variable{..}` / `Expression(_)` / etc.) and folds the witnesses for that attachment into a `ReducedValue`. They live in `witnesses.rs` and register through `ReducerRegistry::with_defaults()`. The worklist driver never special-cases a reducer — it just runs the registry on each attachment.
- **Witnesses are monotone.** Once a witness is in the bag, it stays. New facts append; no reducer rewrites or deletes another's witness. Termination follows from the lattice (`InferredType` is a finite enum, ~12 variants) plus the snapshot check: when nothing new appears in two consecutive iterations, the fixed point is reached.
- **Edges, not values.** If a registry query on attachment `A` already resolves through an edge chase, do NOT re-push the materialized `InferredType(t)` onto `A` as a "cache." That's the parallel-store bug the staircase deleted. Mirrors between attachments go through `Edge(target)`, not `InferredType` copies — see writeback's `MethodOnClass{class, name} → Edge(Symbol(sid))` for the canonical shape.
- **Re-emittable passes are clear-and-emit.** Every builder pass that legitimately re-derives its bag contribution per iteration calls `WitnessBag::remove_by_source_tag(...)` at the start of every run, then re-pushes from current state. Current re-emittable tags: `arity_detection` (per-Symbol UnionOnArgs), `method_call_return` (call-site `Edge(MethodOnClass{...})`), `local_return` / `plugin_bridge` / `inheritance` (writeback), `call_binding` (propagator). Chain typing's TC-existence check serves the same role for chain-assignment witnesses. Anything else added to a fold step that pushes witnesses MUST follow this idempotency pattern or the worklist will spin.
- **Walker only observes.** No walk-time function returns a type without first emitting the witness. `emit_expr_witness` is the canonical entry; `expr_payload` carries the closed-syntax bake for literals and the `Edge` payloads for name-dependent shapes. Consumers that need a type at walk time do `emit_expr_witness(node); bag_query_expr_span(span)` — emit first, query after.
- **Source priority breaks ties.** `WitnessSource::priority()` returns 100 for `Plugin(_)` and 10 for everything else. The `PluginOverrideReducer` runs first in the registry and short-circuits when it sees a higher-priority witness on a Symbol attachment. New "this answer must dominate" sources go on this priority axis — never as a special-case branch in another reducer.
- **`TypeConstraint` writes go through `push_type_constraint(tc)`.** The struct is an input-parameter shape; the helper translates it into Variable witnesses on the bag. No `Vec<TypeConstraint>` field exists — the bag is the only storage. Direct bag pushes that bypass `push_type_constraint` are allowed (it's just a sugar wrapper) but miss the `ClassAssertion` / `FirstParamInMethod` Observation companions; prefer the helper for `InferredType::ClassName` / `FirstParam` payloads.

### Debugging type inference

`perl-lsp --dump-package <root> <package>` runs full server startup (workspace index, SQLite warm, on-demand @INC resolve, enrichment) then dumps every sub in `<package>` as JSON. Per sub: bag-resolved params, `return_type`, arity-projected returns at 0/1/2/None, witness count, framework, parents, plus:

- **`return_type_provenance`** — traces every non-default return type. `PluginOverride{plugin_id, reason}`, `ReducerFold{reducer, evidence}` (e.g. `reducer="return_arms"`), `Delegation{delegation_kind, via}`. Wire new derivation paths via `Builder.type_provenance` keyed by SymbolId; flushes into `FileAnalysis.type_provenance`. Variants in `file_analysis.rs::TypeProvenance`.
- **`vars_in_scope`** — every TC scoped to the sub's body. Surfaces chain assignment results: `$route` typed as `Mojolicious::Routes::Route` → chain typer worked. Combine with provenance on each method in the chain to find which hop broke.

## tree-sitter-perl gotchas

- `subroutine_declaration_statement` / `method_declaration_statement` — fields: `name`, `body`, `lexical`.
- `variable_declaration` — `variable` (single) or `variables` (paren list).
- `package_statement` / `class_statement` / `use_statement` — field: `name` / `module`.
- `function_call_expression` (with parens) vs `ambiguous_function_call_expression` (no parens, includes `bless { ... }`).
- `method_call_expression` — `invocant`, `method`.
- `scalar` / `array` / `hash` = sigil + varname.
- `child_by_field_name("right")` on `assignment_expression` returns `(` paren — iterate `named_child(i)` instead.
- `child_by_field_name("hash")` on `$obj->{key}` returns None — use first named child.
- ERROR nodes wrap subs in incomplete source — scan ERROR children for patterns like `my ($self) = @_`.

## Inheritance & frameworks

- `package_parents: HashMap<String, Vec<String>>` — unified from `use parent`, `use base`, `@ISA`, `class :isa`, `class :does`, `with` (Moo/Moose), `__PACKAGE__->load_components` (DBIC).
- `resolve_method_in_ancestors()` — DFS parent walk (Perl's default MRO), depth limit 20. `MethodResolution::Local { class, sym_id }` vs `CrossFile { class }`.
- `complete_methods_for_class` walks ancestors, dedups by name (child shadows parent).
- Frameworks (`FrameworkMode::{Moo, Moose, MojoBase}`) detected per-package from `use`. `has 'name' => (...)` synthesizes Method symbol + HashKeyDefs (constructor key + internal hash key). `isa` constraints map to `InferredType` (`Str`/`Int`/`HashRef`/`InstanceOf['X']`/...). Mojo::Base accessors get fluent `ClassName(current_package)` return.
- DBIC: `__PACKAGE__->add_columns` / `has_many` / `belongs_to` / `has_one` / `might_have` synthesize accessors with typed returns.
- Synthesized methods are standard symbols — completion/hover/goto-def/inheritance just work, including cross-file (resolver runs full builder).

## Workspace indexing

- `workspace_index` indexed at startup (Rayon `par_iter`, `.gitignore`-aware via `ignore` crate, 1MB cap, `catch_unwind` per file).
- File watcher via `workspace/didChangeWatchedFiles` for incremental updates (`spawn_blocking`).
- Query priority: `documents` (open, freshest) → `workspace_index` (all project files) → `module_index` (external @INC).

## LSP capabilities

documentSymbol, definition, references, hover, rename (+ prepareRename), completion, signatureHelp, inlayHint, documentHighlight, selectionRange, foldingRange, formatting (perltidy), rangeFormatting, semanticTokens/full, codeAction (auto-import), linkedEditingRange, workspace/symbol, diagnostics (unresolved function/method warnings).
